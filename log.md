# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 18,2020 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start #100daysofcode, selected FCC's responsive-web-design path

**Thoughts:** I battled between python or web-devlopment. Although I've few experience here & there it mostly is stackoverflow. Weighing con's & pro's, I finally decided to give web-devlopment a shot. Promising to return to python after completing 4 cert. from FCC. 
1. Responsive Web Design
2. Javascript Algorithms & Data Structures
3. Fron End Libraries
4. Data Visualization

**Link to work:** None today
